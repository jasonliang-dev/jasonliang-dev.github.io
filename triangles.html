  <h1 class="mt1">Drawing A Triangle 7 Ways</h1>
  <div class="lh-copy">
    <p>The "Hello, World" of graphics programming is a program that displays a
triangle to the screen. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/static/triangles/triangle.png" alt="A colored triangle" /></p>
<p>I'll be drawing the exact same triangle for the following APIs/libraries,
comparing their similarities and differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>SDL2 + OpenGL</li>
<li>SDL2 + WebGPU</li>
<li>SDL2 + Vulkan</li>
<li>Win32 + Direct3D 11</li>
<li>HTML + WebGL 2</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/floooh/sokol">Sokol</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the programs handle window resizing, stretching the triangle when the
window size increases, and squishing the triangle when the window size
decreases. All programs involve a vertex buffer with position and color
information. No vertex information is stored in shader code. That's cheating.
The programs don't perform a "proper" teardown since most of the resources,
like window handles and pipelines, lives for the entire lifetime of the
program.</p>
<h2>SDL2 + OpenGL</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jasonliang-dev/7-triangles/blob/master/sdl2-opengl.cpp">Source code (121 lines)</a></p>
<p>I think most people who get into graphics programming today are introduced to
it through OpenGL, thanks in no small part to
<a href="https://learnopengl.com/">Learn OpenGL</a>. Despite its age and deprecated
status on macOS, it's still a decent API for learning graphics and remains
popular to this day. The code example uses OpenGL 3.3, the same version used
in Learn OpenGL.</p>
<p>OpenGL either hides/abstracts things that other APIs freely expose, or it
makes the windowing API responsible for the graphics behavior. With SDL2 and
OpenGL, swapping the back/front buffers happens through <code>SDL_GL_SwapWindow</code>.
In other APIs like D3D11, The swap chain object is responsible for presenting
and swapping the image buffers.</p>
<p>One of the pain points about OpenGL is that you'll need a loading library such
as <a href="https://gen.glad.sh/">glad</a> or <a href="https://glew.sourceforge.net/">GLEW</a> to
access the modern OpenGL functions (by modern, I mean VAOs and shaders, not
DSA). Loading these functions differs depending on the platform/library. For
example, SDL2 has <code>SDL_GL_GetProcAddress</code>, Linux has X11 has
<code>glXGetProcAddress</code>. For Windows, you'll need to create an invisible dummy
window to get the <code>wglGetProcAddress</code> function before creating your actual
application window.</p>
<p>I picked SDL2 for setting up a window and OpenGL context. Both SDL2 and OpenGL
support many different platforms, so they pair very well together. The next
few examples also uses SDL2 for the same reason.</p>
<h2>SDL2 + WebGPU</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jasonliang-dev/7-triangles/blob/master/sdl2-webgpu.cpp">Source code (234 lines)</a></p>
<p>As of writing this, the only browser that supports WebGPU out of the box is
Chrome. But the WebGPU API is also accessible on desktop through
<a href="https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn">Dawn</a> or <a href="https://wgpu.rs/">wgpu</a>.</p>
<p>Again, I'm using SDL2 for window creation because of its cross platform
support. WebGPU is also cross platform by unifying access to the GPU,
building on top of platform specific APIs like Metal, and D3D12.</p>
<p>Metal, Direct3D, and Vulkan all differ when it comes to shading languages.
Metal has MSL, Direct3D 11 and 12 has HLSL, and Vulkan uses SPIR-V bytecode
which can be compiled from GLSL. WebGPU introduces its own shader language
called WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language), and it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-wgsl">struct VertexIn {
  @location(0) position: vec3f,
  @location(1) color: vec4f,
}

struct VertexOut {
  @builtin(position) position: vec4f,
  @location(1) color: vec4f,
}

@vertex fn vs_main(in: VertexIn) -&gt; VertexOut {
  var out: VertexOut;
  out.position = vec4f(in.position, 1.0f);
  out.color = in.color;
  return out;
}

@fragment fn fs_main(in: VertexOut) -&gt; @location(0) vec4f {
  return in.color;
}</code></pre>
<p>Compared to OpenGL, you'll need to perform more housekeeping with WebGPU.
You'll work with swap chains, render pipelines, command buffers, and queues.
Even though there's more control with the hardware, the abstraction level is
high level enough to be used by mortals such as myself.</p>
<p>You'll need a <code>WGPUSurface</code> window surface to draw on, which depends on an OS
specific window handle (<code>HWND</code> on Windows, <code>Display *</code> and <code>Window</code> for X11
on Linux). Getting the window handle to create a surface is the only platform
specific code path needed to draw a triangle.</p>
<p>Because WebGPU is designed for the web, you'll need to wait for asynchronous
callbacks to finish. It differs depending on the implementation. For Dawn,
you'll have to call <code>wgpuDeviceTick</code>. wgpu uses <code>wgpuDevicePoll</code>. The
JavaScript API doesn't have this, because the browser has an event loop.</p>
<p>Although it's early days for WebGPU, I'm optimistic with what it could bring
to both the web and on desktop.</p>
<h2>SDL2 + Vulkan</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jasonliang-dev/7-triangles/blob/master/sdl2-vulkan.cpp">Source code (846 lines)</a></p>
<p>Vulkan is known for being difficult to learn, especially for beginners.
Writing over 800 lines of C++ to draw a triangle on the screen just does not
spark joy to some people.</p>
<p>Learning materials such as <a href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com/">Vulkan Tutorial</a>
mention downloading the Vulkan SDK when setting up a development environment.
The setup is more involved than I would like, but there exists a Vulkan
loader that doesn't need the official SDK to build your program. It's called
<a href="https://github.com/mackron/vkbind">vkbind</a> and it's made by the same person
behind <a href="https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio">miniaudio</a>.</p>
<p>Even with vkbind, you might want to install the SDK anyways. Vulkan uses a
bytecode format called SPIR-V when creating shaders programs and the SDK
provides <code>glslangValidator</code>, a program that converts human readable GLSL to
SPIR-V. This means building a Vulkan application is at least a two step
process. Build the shaders first, then the actual program. There are ways to
compile to SPIR-V at runtime but it's typical to compile offline so you don't
distribute GLSL as part of your application.</p>
<p>For all of the code examples, I tried to keep the C++ features to a minimum,
making it easier to translate to C if needed. The Vulkan example is the only
example that uses the STL (<code>std::vector</code>). Some of the Vulkan functions
involve calling it once for an item count, and again to actually fill up a
buffer of items. Doing this without <code>std::vector</code> just adds friction to what
is already a lot of code for drawing a triangle.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">// with std::vector
uint32_t count = 0;
vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(instance, &amp;count, nullptr);
std::vector&lt;VkPhysicalDevice&gt; physical_devices(count);
vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(instance, &amp;count, physical_devices.data());

// with malloc
uint32_t count = 0;
vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(instance, &amp;count, nullptr);
VkPhysicalDevice *physical_devices =
  (VkPhysicalDevice *)malloc(count * sizeof(VkPhysicalDevice));
vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(instance, &amp;count, physical_devices);
// then probably a few lines below, a call to free()</code></pre>
<p>For the <code>malloc</code> snippet, I had to type <code>VkPhysicalDevice</code> three times. Once
time for the variable, another for sizeof, and a third time because C++
doesn't like conversions from <code>void *</code>. Spreading this pattern across
hundreds of lines was not someone I was up for. In retrospect, I could have
used fixed sized buffers with an extra length variable for each buffer
instead.</p>
<p>Vulkan tries to be cross platform, but because Apple wants a closed off
environment for macOS and iOS, Vulkan is only native for Windows, Linux, and
Android. You'll need to use MoltenVK to act as a translation layer between
Vulkan and Metal if you want to talk to macOS machines.</p>
<p>Just like WebGPU, the only platform specific code path to draw a triangle is
to get the OS window handle for <code>VkSurfaceKHR</code> window surface creation.</p>
<p>Handing window resize requires more work compared to OpenGL and WebGPU. In
OpenGL you just call <code>glViewport</code>. In WebGPU, you recreate the swap chain. In
Vulkan, you have to recreate the swap chain, as well as a collection of frame
buffers and image views associated with the swap chain.</p>
<p>Vulkan also provides synchronization primitives since the GPU is doing work
asynchronously. Getting an image from the swap chain needs to be synchronized
with semaphores and waiting on the GPU to finish commands is done with
fences.</p>
<h2>Win32 + Direct3D 11</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jasonliang-dev/7-triangles/blob/master/win32-d3d11.cpp">Source code (213 lines)</a></p>
<p>I really wish there was a Learn OpenGL equivalent for D3D11. It's a very
pleasant API to use, and I would work with it more if it weren't for the fact
that D3D11 is made for Windows only. Although, people joke that Direct3D is
the best cross platform API since Windows users can run it natively, Linux
users can run it through Proton, and Mac users run can Windows through Boot
Camp.</p>
<p>I'm using Win32 for window creation. Since D3D11 is only native to Windows, it
makes sense to use the native windowing API as well. Some OpenGL and Vulkan
tutorials describe how horrible the Win32 API is, but the code doesn't look
too different compared to a cross platform library like SDL2.</p>
<p>Here is a minimal SDL2 application:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">#include &lt;SDL2/SDL.h&gt;

int main() {
  SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO | SDL_INIT_EVENTS);

  int width = 800, height = 600;
  SDL_Window *window = SDL_CreateWindow("Window Title", SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
                                        SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, width, height,
                                        SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE);
  bool should_quit = false;
  while (!should_quit) {
    SDL_Event e = {};
    while (SDL_PollEvent(&amp;e)) {
      if (e.type == SDL_QUIT) {
        should_quit = true;
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>And here is Win32:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

LRESULT CALLBACK wnd_proc(HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wparam, LPARAM lparam) {
  switch (msg) {
  case WM_DESTROY:
    PostQuitMessage(0);
    return 0;
  default:
    return DefWindowProc(hwnd, msg, wparam, lparam);
  }
}

int main() {
  const char *title = "Window Title";

  WNDCLASSA wc = {};
  wc.lpfnWndProc = wnd_proc;
  wc.hCursor = LoadCursor(nullptr, IDC_ARROW);
  wc.lpszClassName = title;
  RegisterClassA(&amp;wc);

  int width = 800, height = 600;
  HWND hwnd = CreateWindowExA(0, title, title, WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW | WS_VISIBLE,
                              CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, width, height,
                              nullptr, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);
  bool should_quit = false;
  while (!should_quit) {
    MSG msg = {};
    while (PeekMessage(&amp;msg, nullptr, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE)) {
      TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
      DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);

      if (msg.message == WM_QUIT) {
        should_quit = true;
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>They both look similar, but only if you squint. Both Win32 and SDL2 use a
function to create a window, and a loop to poll for events. If you get rid of
the window procedure callback and the call to <code>RegisterClassA</code>, the
differences aren't too far from SDL2.</p>
<p>Direct3D's shader language is HLSL (High-level shader language). One of the
advantages of HLSL is that you can write your vertex and pixel shader code in
the same file. The same is also true for WGSL. You'll often see that the
vertex shader code and fragment shader code are separated into multiple files
for OpenGL and Vulkan programs.</p>
<p>You can compile HLSL by calling <code>D3DCompile</code>. The function is accessible by
linking the application with <code>d3dcompiler.lib</code>, but I previously had problems
compiling my program with Clang with that approach. Instead, I dynamically
loaded <code>d3dcompiler_47.dll</code>, and got the function pointer for <code>D3DCompile</code>
from the DLL.</p>
<p>When describing vertex attribute layouts, there's the option to use
<code>D3D11_APPEND_ALIGNED_ELEMENT</code> to say that the attribute begins right after
the previous one. This is pretty convenient, since the vertex attribute
offset doesn't need to be calculated. Unfortunately, some of the convenience
is lost since you need a HLSL semantic name for each vertex attribute.</p>
<h2>HTML + WebGL 2</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jasonliang-dev/7-triangles/blob/master/webgl2.html">Source code (102 lines)</a></p>
<p>WebGL 2 lets you write graphics applications right in the browser using an API
that's close to OpenGL ES 3.0. The benefit of writing for the web is that
it's readily available on practically every modern device. WebGL uses ANGLE
to translate its API to a platform specific API like Direct3D, OpenGL, or
Metal. Deploying your application for the web is a great way to make it reach
more people, since users don't have to install an executable to run it
natively. Also, if you're learning OpenGL, but you're in an environment where
you don't have a compiler, you can still do some graphics programming right
in the browser.</p>
<p>The big drawback of WebGL is that the tooling is poor. You won't be running
RenderDoc on your WebGL application. You also won't see demanding graphics
very often on the web. If high fidelity is the goal, running in the browser
might not be a good fit.</p>
<p>The other code examples define a struct for a single vertex, but WebGL expects
a <code>Float32Array</code> when filling in vertex buffer data. Since JavaScript really
doesn't have a way to trivially convert objects to a flat array of numbers,
the vertex attributes aren't neatly grouped up. There's no <code>offsetof</code>, so the
attribute offsets need to be calculated by hand, and since there's no vertex
struct, the vertex stride is hard-coded.</p>
<p>Also, the code looks similar to the SDL2 + OpenGL example, which kind of makes
sense I guess.</p>
<h2>Sokol</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jasonliang-dev/7-triangles/blob/master/sokol.cpp">Source code (110 lines)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/floooh/sokol">Sokol</a> is a collection of single header
files for C and C++. <code>sokol_gfx.h</code> unifies OpenGL 3.3, WebGL 2, Direct3D 11,
and Metal into a single 3D API. <code>sokol_app.h</code> is a cross platform library
that provides a window to draw onto. The Sokol libraries are dependency free
and are easy to build with. They make heavy use of structs as parameters to
functions. This is fantastic when paired with C99's designated initializers.</p>
<p>sokol_gfx only has five resources that you keep track of: buffers, shaders,
pipeline state objects, images, and render passes. It also has good error
handling through its validation layer. When using the OpenGL backend, state
changes are cached which improves performance.</p>
<p>sokol_gfx doesn't have a cross compatible shader language, but there is a
tool called
<a href="https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/blob/master/docs/sokol-shdc.md">sokol-shdc</a>
that translates a GLSL-like file into a C header file that contains shader
code for multiple backends. Just like with Vulkan, you'll be doing this
offline.</p>
<p>sokol_app makes it incredibly easy to port a C/C++ desktop application to the
web with Emscripten. Since sokol_app is mindful of the web as a target
platform, the way you write application code also changes. Initialization,
event polling, and the update loop is all done through callbacks.</p>
<p>There are tons of
<a href="https://floooh.github.io/sokol-html5/index.html">examples</a> you can look at to
learn Sokol. You'll find examples for offscreen rendering, model loading with
cgltf, and ImGui support. There are also language bindings for Zig, Odin,
Nim, and Rust.</p>
<h2>raylib</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a> is a library for making games in C. It
provides an immediate mode rendering API with <code>rlgl.h</code> which uses OpenGL
under the hood. The raylib code is so short that I can just paste it here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">#include &lt;raylib.h&gt;
#include &lt;rlgl.h&gt;

int main() {
  SetConfigFlags(FLAG_WINDOW_RESIZABLE);
  InitWindow(800, 600, "raylib + rlgl");

  while (!WindowShouldClose()) {
    BeginDrawing();
    ClearBackground({128, 128, 128, 255});

    rlMatrixMode(RL_PROJECTION);
    rlLoadIdentity();

    rlBegin(RL_TRIANGLES);
    rlColor4f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f); rlVertex3f(+0.0f, +0.5f, 0.0f);
    rlColor4f(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f); rlVertex3f(-0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f);
    rlColor4f(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f); rlVertex3f(+0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f);
    rlEnd();

    EndDrawing();
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Isn't it nice to have a library that just needs two functions for windowing?
<code>InitWindow</code> and <code>WindowShouldClose</code> is all you need.</p>
<p>raylib's rendering API is the same style as OpenGL 1.1. This doesn't mean
raylib is using a version of OpenGL back in 1997. Instead, it wraps multiple
versions of OpenGL, using version 3.3 as the default. Internally, it creates
dynamic vertex buffers that lives on the GPU and arrays of position and color
data that gets written to every time <code>rlVertex3f</code> is called. At the end of
the frame, the buffers are "flushed", transferring the data from memory to
the vertex buffers that live on the GPU.</p>
<p>raylib is at a much higher level of abstraction compared to the previously
explored options. It assumes you'll be drawing things like images and text,
so Raylib starts the program with an orthographic projection that matches the
size of the window. <code>rlMatrixMode(RL_PROJECTION)</code> and <code>rlLoadIdentity()</code> is
called to reset the projection matrix so that the vertex positions will be in
their proper place when its time to draw on the screen.</p>
<p>Because of the way raylib's renderer works, it uses the same shader to draw
color filled rectangles and textures that you load from image files. This is
only achievable by always having at least one texture bound. When the user
draws something with no texture, such as a filled rectangle, it uses an
internal 1x1 white texture to sample from.</p>
<p>raylib is very enjoyable to use as a video game library. I can definitely
recommend it for beginner programmers who want to make their first few 2D
games. The raylib source code is also on GitHub so you can read it to learn
more about OpenGL and game framework architecture in C.</p>
<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Depending on the library/API that you choose, the path to the first triangle
can either be an easy one (raylib), or a lengthy and difficult one
(Vulkan). You have the option for your program run on multiple devices with
SDL2, or on specific platforms like Windows, or the browser.</p>
<p>The "Hello, Triangle" program doesn't paint the whole picture of what these
APIs give you, and what they need when your program increases in complexity.
Multisampling is easy with OpenGL, but is a little more involved with
Direct3D 11. You probably won't work with uniforms in a library like raylib,
but with Vulkan, you'll need to deal with descriptor pools, descriptor sets,
and how they interact with shaders.</p>  </div>
